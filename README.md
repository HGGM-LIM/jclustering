# jClustering

## Introduction

This documentation explains how to use jClustering and how to develop a new
clustering technique or metric for the jClustering framework using simple
examples and code snippets. Several working examples will be attached to this
document annex for full reference.

## What is jClustering?

jClustering is an [ImageJ](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) plugin developed with the
purpose of becoming a general framework for dynamic imaging clustering, such as
dynamic PET segmentation. jClustering is written in Java and provides a very
simple API interface that will allow the implementation of new clustering
algorithms in a short time. The fact that it is implemented on top of ImageJ
gives it all the advantages of using an open-source imaging analysis platform.
