v1.2.6 - 2013-08-21
-------------------

- Fixed a bug in k-means++ initialization distance computation.

v1.2.5 - 2013-08-08
-------------------

- SVD did not work if the soon-to-be-deprecated (hopefully) skip_noisy was not set to true.
- The logic for not returning masked voxels did not work as expected. Fixed.
- ImagePlusHypIterator rewritten (nasty bug showed up when correct pixel masking was implemented).

v1.2.4 - 2013-08-05
-------------------

- ImagePlusHypIterator does not return masked voxels
- Added isMasked(Voxel v) and isMasked(double [] tac) to MathUtils
- K-means initialization algorithms do not choose masked voxels
- Skip noisy voxels is now set to false (might be deprecated in the future).
- LeaderFollower number of clusters is 50 by default (from 1000).
- ImagePlusHyp is now just a wrapper for ImagePlus, but does not extend it.
  This avoids duplicating the memory used by the analyzed image.

v1.2.3 - 2013-07-16
-------------------

- Added "About" panel.
- Included deterministic k-means++ initialization.
- Fixed Leader-Follower bug.
- Added RMSD metric.

v1.2.2 - 2013-03-07
-------------------

- PCA can now be computed on the correlation matrix instead of the covariance.
- Additional images from PCA, ICA and SVD use a floating point format.

v1.2.1 - 2013-03-05
-------------------

- Fixed bug: number of components was ignored in ICA.

v1.2.0 - 2013-03-04
-------------------

- ClusteringTechniques can now return a formatted string array that will be saved as additional information.
- Added ICA implementation thanks to the fastICA library by Michael Lambertz.  
- Added SVD implementation.

v1.1.9 - 2013-02-27
-------------------

- Added an option for displaying the PCA image in the PCA technique.
- PCA computation now uses SVD on the covariance matrix instead of obtaining
  the eigenvectors manually.

v1.1.8 - 2012-10-22
-------------------

- Fixed yet another major bug in LeaderFollower implementation.
- cluster image now has correct voxel size information.

v1.1.7 - 2012-09-28
-------------------

- Fixed major bug in LeaderFollower implementation.

v1.1.6 - 2012-09-27
-------------------

- Added kmeans++ initialization.
- It is now redistributable as a .jar file thanks to Johannes Schindelin.

v1.1.5 - 2012-09-24
-------------------

- Uses calibration data from the image to return calibrated TACs.
- Use SSE to compute when K-Means should stop.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements.

v1.1.4 - 2012-09-10
-------------------

- Fixed a null pointer problem when saving data from an empty cluster.

- Fixed cluster behavior and updated documentation.


v1.1.3 - 2012-09-06
-------------------

- Added PCA technique.


v1.1.2 - 2012-09-06
-------------------

- ImagePlusHyp now implements Iterable<Vector> and is much easier to go
  through all the voxels in an image.


v1.0.2 - 2012-08-31
-------------------

- Mahalanobis distance implemented.


v1.0.1 - 2012-08-31
-------------------

- Leader-follower can now discard the smallest cluster (according to
  Cluster.score() method) if cluster limit has been reached.

- New javadoc.


v1.0.0 - 2012-08-31
-------------------

- First released version. Implements K-Means and Leader-follower clustering
  techniques and two metrics: correlation and p-norm.
