v1.2.1 - 03/05/2013
-------------------

- Fixed bug: number of components was ignored in ICA.

v1.2.0 - 03/04/2013
-------------------

- ClusteringTechniques can now return a formatted string array that will be saved as additional information.
- Added ICA implementation thanks to the fastICA library by Michael Lambertz.  
- Added SVD implementation.

v1.1.9 - 02/27/2013
-------------------

- Added an option for displaying the PCA image in the PCA technique.
- PCA computation now uses SVD on the covariance matrix instead of obtaining
  the eigenvectors manually.

v1.1.8 - 10/22/2012
-------------------

- Fixed yet another major bug in LeaderFollower implementation.
- cluster image now has correct voxel size information.

v1.1.7 - 09/28/2012
-------------------

- Fixed major bug in LeaderFollower implementation.

v1.1.6 - 09/27/2012
-------------------

- Added kmeans++ initialization.
- It is now redistributable as a .jar file thanks to Johannes Schindelin.

v1.1.5 - 09/24/2012
-------------------

- Uses calibration data from the image to return calibrated TACs.
- Use SSE to compute when K-Means should stop.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements.

v1.1.4 - 09/10/2012
-------------------

- Fixed a null pointer problem when saving data from an empty cluster.

- Fixed cluster behavior and updated documentation.


v1.1.3 - 09/06/2012
-------------------

- Added PCA technique.


v1.1.2 - 09/06/2012
-------------------

- ImagePlusHyp now implements Iterable<Vector> and is much easier to go
  through all the voxels in an image.


v1.0.2 - 08/31/2012
-------------------

- Mahalanobis distance implemented.


v1.0.1 - 08/31/2012
-------------------

- Leader-follower can now discard the smallest cluster (according to
  Cluster.score() method) if cluster limit has been reached.

- New javadoc.


v1.0.0 - 08/31/2012
-------------------

- First released version. Implements K-Means and Leader-follower clustering
  techniques and two metrics: correlation and p-norm.
